This script reads word definitions from a JSON file and allows users to look up the definition of a word by entering it. If the word exists in the JSON data, the script prints its definition; otherwise, it displays a message indicating that the word was not found.

Execute the Python script to look up word definitions:

``python define_word.py``

Enter the word for which you want to retrieve the definition when prompted.

Ensure that the JSON file (data.json in this case) exists and is correctly formatted with word definitions and modify the script to handle different JSON data structures or sources if necessary.
